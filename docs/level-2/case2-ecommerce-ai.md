## Level 0 Analysis: Strategic Foundation

### Global Question 1: "WHY?"

**"Why should this product exist and what fundamental problem does it solve?"**

**Response from ShopWave PM**:

"Our platform currently faces three interconnected problems:

1. **Conversion Challenge**: Our merchants struggle with a 'discovery problem' – 72% of their products receive less than 5% of total traffic, creating a long-tail visibility issue. This results in lower overall conversion rates (2.7% vs. 3.5%+ for platforms with advanced recommendation engines).

2. **Personalization Gap**: Our user research shows that 76% of our shoppers find current product discovery "generic and unhelpful," with 64% reporting they would purchase more if shown more relevant products. Exit surveys indicate 38% of abandoned carts occur because "couldn't find exactly what I wanted."

3. **Merchant Retention Risk**: We're seeing increased merchant churn (up 8% YoY), with exit interviews citing "better conversion tools on competing platforms" as the #2 reason for leaving (cited by 47% of departing merchants).

The AI recommendation system solves these problems by creating a virtuous cycle: better product discovery leads to higher conversion rates, which increases merchant satisfaction and retention, which brings more product variety, which improves the consumer experience, which drives more traffic and higher conversion.

This directly supports our company mission of 'empowering independent brands to thrive online' by addressing the fundamental challenge of connecting the right products with the right customers at the right time."

**Score: 9/10**

**Justification**: The response demonstrates an excellent understanding of the interconnected problems faced by both merchants and consumers, with strong quantitative evidence. The clear articulation of the "virtuous cycle" shows strategic thinking about how the solution addresses multiple stakeholders' needs simultaneously. The direct connection to the company mission is well-established. The only minor gap is in quantifying the economic impact of the current problems on the company's bottom line.

### Global Question 2: "FOR WHOM?"
